I'm a developer by chance and a system administrator by choice. My constant endeavor at work is to excel in whatever I do and engineer it to perfection.

I'm currently redefining my skill set and career with an amazing support from friends and boy I'm loving this metamorphosis!

- coder
- analyser and problem solver

- go-getter
- perfectionist
- honest(world #1)
- not a jerk
- good communicator
- 0% hypocrite (afaik)
- feedback giver and taker

# What do I like...
